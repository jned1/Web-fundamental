# Web Fundamentals

This repository documents my learning journey through **Web Fundamentals**, with a focus on how the web works and how security fits into it.

The goal is not to memorize tools, but to understand **core concepts** that are essential for web development, penetration testing, and web security.

## 🎯 Course Focus

This repository covers foundational topics such as:

- How the web works at a protocol level
- How browsers and servers communicate
- Core HTTP concepts (requests, responses, headers)
- Basic web architecture
- Fundamental web security concepts

These topics are critical before moving into:
- Web application security
- OWASP Top 10
- Bug bounty and penetration testing

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Web architecture (client ↔ server model)
- HTTP and HTTPS
- Requests and responses
- HTTP methods and status codes
- Headers and cookies
- Sessions and authentication basics
- Same-Origin Policy and CORS
- Introduction to common web vulnerabilities

---

## 🧠 Learning Approach

- Focus on **understanding**, not memorization  
- Document only what is **important or easy to forget**
- Write notes for **future reference**, not perfection
- Treat this repository as a **personal knowledge base**

---

## 🚀 Why This Matters for Security

Most web vulnerabilities exist because of:
- misunderstanding HTTP behavior
- incorrect authentication logic
- browser security assumptions

A strong foundation in web fundamentals is essential before studying:
- SQL Injection
- XSS
- CSRF
- Authentication flaws
