# 🌐 HTTP in Detail  
*(Based on TryHackMe – Web Fundamentals)*

## 1. What is HTTP and Why It Exists

**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** is an **application-layer protocol** that defines how a **client** (such as a web browser) communicates with a **server** (a web server).

Its main job is to allow clients to request resources (HTML pages, images, JSON data, etc.) and for servers to respond in a predictable, standardized way.

HTTP exists because:
- Computers communicate using structured rules, not assumptions
- The web needs a common language for data exchange
- Applications need a reliable way to request and send information

HTTP was designed to be:
- **Stateless**: each request is independent
- **Text-based**: human-readable and easy to debug
- **Extensible**: new headers and methods can be added over time

---

## 2. How HTTP Works Internally (Step by Step)

A typical HTTP request follows this flow:

1. **DNS Resolution**  
   The browser resolves the domain name into an IP address.

2. **TCP Connection**  
   A TCP connection is established to the server (usually port 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS).

3. **HTTP Request Sent**  
   The client sends an HTTP request containing a method, headers, and optionally a body.

4. **Server Processing**  
   The server interprets the request and processes it (static file, database query, API logic).

5. **HTTP Response Returned**  
   The server sends a response containing a status code, headers, and data.

6. **Connection Closed or Reused**  
   Depending on headers, the connection may stay open or close.

Important note:  
HTTP itself does **not provide encryption**. Encryption is handled by HTTPS using TLS.

## 3. Key HTTP Components and Terminology

### 3.1 HTTP Request Structure

An HTTP request has three main parts:

```bash
GET /login HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
```

**Request Line**
- **Method**: action to perform (GET, POST, etc.)
- **Path**: resource being requested
- **Version**: HTTP protocol version

**Headers**
- Metadata describing the request
- Examples: `Host`, `User-Agent`, `Cookie`, `Authorization`

**Body (Optional)**
- Used to send data to the server (commonly in POST or PUT requests)

---

### 3.2 HTTP Methods

Common HTTP methods include:
- **GET**: retrieve data
- **POST**: send data to the server
- **PUT**: update an existing resource
- **DELETE**: remove a resource

Security note:  
Sensitive data should never be sent using GET because URLs can be logged and cached.

---

### 3.3 HTTP Response Structure

Example response:
```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1234
```

**Status Line**
- Indicates whether the request succeeded or failed

**Headers**
- Provide metadata about the response

**Body**
- The actual content returned by the server

---

### 3.4 HTTP Status Codes

Status codes are grouped by category:
- **1xx**: informational
- **2xx**: success
- **3xx**: redirection
- **4xx**: client errors
- **5xx**: server errors

Examples:
- `200 OK`
- `301 Moved Permanently`
- `401 Unauthorized`
- `403 Forbidden`
- `404 Not Found`
- `500 Internal Server Error`

---

## 4. Real-World HTTP Examples

### Login Form Submission

```bash
POST /login HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=admin&password=123456
```

If this request is sent over plain HTTP:
- Credentials are visible in clear text
- Attackers can intercept them easily

---

### API Request Example

```bash
GET /api/users HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Modern web applications rely heavily on HTTP-based APIs.

---

## 5. Security Relevance and Attacker Perspective

HTTP is a primary attack surface because:
- It carries user input
- It handles authentication and sessions
- It exposes application logic

Attackers inspect:
- URL parameters
- Headers
- Cookies
- Response behavior

Understanding HTTP is essential for finding vulnerabilities such as injection, authentication bypass, and logic flaws.

---

## 6. Common HTTP Misconfigurations and Attacks

### Cleartext HTTP
- Allows traffic sniffing and man-in-the-middle attacks

### Insecure Cookies
- Missing `Secure` or `HttpOnly` flags
- Can lead to session hijacking

### Parameter Tampering
- Modifying request values to bypass application logic

### HTTP Request Smuggling
- Exploiting differences between proxy and backend request parsing

---

## 7. Defensive Practices and Mitigations

- Enforce HTTPS everywhere
- Validate and sanitize all user input
- Use secure cookie attributes
- Apply proper authentication and authorization checks
- Monitor HTTP logs for suspicious activity

Security starts at the protocol level, not only in application code.

---

## 8. Summary

HTTP is the foundation of all web communication.  
A strong understanding of HTTP enables:
- Better debugging
- Safer web development
- Effective web penetration testing

Every web security skill builds on top of HTTP knowledge.
